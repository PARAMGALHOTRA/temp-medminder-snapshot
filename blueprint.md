# MedMinder Application Blueprint

## Overview

MedMinder is a Flutter application designed to help users manage their medication schedules. The app allows users to log in, add their medications, set reminders, and track their daily progress.

## Style and Design

The application follows Material Design 3 principles to provide a modern and intuitive user experience. The UI is designed to be clean, with a focus on readability and ease of use.

- **Theming**: The app uses a centralized `ThemeData` object with a color scheme generated from a seed color. It supports both light and dark modes.
- **Typography**: The app uses the `google_fonts` package for a consistent and visually appealing text style.
- **Iconography**: The app uses Material Design icons to enhance usability and provide clear visual cues.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign in using their Google account.
- **Medication Management**: Users can add, view, and manage their medications.
- **Daily Progress Tracking**: The app displays a circular progress indicator to show the percentage of medicines taken for the day.
- **Next Dose Reminder**: The app highlights the next upcoming medication dose, with a visual indicator for overdue medicines.
- **Categorized Medicine List**: Medicines are categorized into morning, afternoon, and evening sections for better organization.

## Current Plan

- Run the application to ensure all the recent fixes have resolved the runtime errors and the app is functioning as expected.
